## YouTube Clips
YouTube made a feature where you could clip a creators video and when you make a clip it creates its own URL for the clip from the video.

### Archive
I am archving my clips here for anyone who wants to learn more about CS, since the clips are related about CS, Privacy and whatnot.

### Clips
The clips must be like this in order to preserve it due to the nature of how youtube plays videos.
Example:
https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOAz9T96WyU?clip=Ugkxpi0OP9UiDOOUfe1OFPuUXZxLDHpcCIaI&clipt=EPXKGRjVnx0

The **embed** in the url is embedding the video in fullscreen.

**QOAz9T96WyU** is the video ID

**clip=Ugkxpi0OP9UiDOOUfe1OFPuUXZxLDHpcCIaI** is the Clips ID, If you delete a clip it will still remain.

**clipt=EPXKGRjVnx0** I'm not sure what this is but I assume it's the clips ID as well as the video being embedded.
